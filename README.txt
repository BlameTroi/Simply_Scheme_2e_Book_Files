These directories hold supporting files for the textbook...

Harvey, B., & Wright, M. (1999). Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer
Science (2ND ed.). MIT. (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html)

...as downloaded mid January 2025.

Anyone wanting to work through the text needs to load `simply.scm'
into their Scheme system. The other files are recommenced in the
appendix and are found in various chapters throughout the text.

I have tried to use this code with four Schemes: Guile, Chez, Racket,
and Chicken. Only Chicken and Racket work and Racket provides their
own version of "simply.scm" but not the other files.

See "required.scm" for a more detailed discussion of the what, where,
why, and how of loading the environment.

The text is still in copyright and still available to purchase, but
Harvey offers the text online for personal use. The original license
from the text is in `COPYLEFT.txt', my licensing can be found in
`LICENSE' and `MIT-LICENSE' for any derivative work I do.

To boil it down, their license is an early GPL. Anything I write I
consider public domain but for those who require a more explicit
license, you can choose between the UNLICENSE and the MIT License.
